<h2>Education üìö</h2>
  
<p>My name is Gabriel, I am 28 years old, from Paris and I am a student in software engineering since October 2022 at:</p>
<a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank"><img width="222" alt="img_logo_ada_white" src="./logos/ada_tech_school.png" alt="Ada Tech School Logo"></a>

<br>
<br>

<p>At Ada, I am<b> autonomously </b>learning all the programming fundamentals necessary to become a software engineer: programming languages and paradigms, networks and systems, processus, database creation and handling, Q&A and software architecture.</p>

<br>


<h2>Goal üéØ</h2>

<p>Growing a strong interest for data processing, servers' administration and communication and the building of APIs and their routes, my main goal is to find a 12-month apprenticeship as a <strong>back-end software engineer</strong>, starting between June the 12th and July the 7th 2023. I am very curious about back-end engineering and can't wait to learn more about it in depth so I can achieve my goal of becoming a senior back-end engineer in the years to come. </p>

<p><strong>This apprenticeship would work on the basis of Monday to Thursday at work and Fridays at school.</strong></p>

<h2>Projects ‚öôÔ∏è</h2>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/Gabrielparizet/music-recognition-project" alt="Link to sound data repository">Sound Data</a><span> / Ongoing</span></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>About:</ins></strong> Sound data is personal project I started recently and on which I am currently working on my free time.
    The idea is to create a web application through which a user would be able to upload an audio file in order to get musical information about it such as: the tempo (bpm), the length in minutes of the file and a graphical representation of the sound. <br>
    Currently working on a Minimum Viable Product, my goal for the V2 of <strong>Sound Data</strong> is to add the possibility to create an account in order to save the infos of a user's previously analyzed files, so they won't have to upload their files again.
  </li>
  <li><strong><ins>Code:</ins></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The back-end (ongoing) is done in Python with the use of Flask for the building of the API's routes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The audio-files are processed through a python package named <strong>Librosa</strong> which is specifically designed for music and audio analysis.
      </li>
      <li>
        The front-end (ongoing) is created with the use of React.js and Tailwind.css. 
      </li>
      <li>
        In the V2, I am planning to add a MySQL relational database to handle user's account data and the saving of files' slugs.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>School Group Projects</h3>

<p> At Ada Tech School, we have two weeks imposed school group projects every month through which we have to learn new technologies and notions by building the projects's goal application.</p>
<p> By working in an imposed group, we also work on our soft-skills, learning to communicate and to work in a team on the development of a program while using <strong>agile software development methods</strong>.</p>

<br>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/Gabrielparizet/Comfy_Studio" alt="Comfy Studio project repository">Comfy Studio</a><span> / March 2023</span></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>About:</ins></strong> Comfy Studio is a second-hand furniture webstore developed from scratch in a group of ten classmates. <br>
    Spread over two weeks, our group was divided in two, with one half working on the back-end, while the other worked on the front, before exchanging roles during the second week. <br>
    Deciding that we should have two teamleaders for each side of the development team, I was appointed back-end teamleader. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Programming languages:</ins></strong> Creating this webstore application from scratch, we had complete liberty over our choice of technologies.
    The front-end of the project was hence developed using <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Tailwind.css</strong> for styles. <br>
    Being the first project where we had to create an entire back-end side of the application, my personal choice was to lean over the <strong>MERN</strong> stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the entire project. However, prefering to practice our recently acquired MySQL skills, we decided to lean over a back-end side done in <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express.js</strong> and raw <strong>MySQL</strong> using Node.js <strong>Sequelize</strong> module.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Teamwork and cooperation:</ins></strong> Comfy Studio was quite a challenging project as it was the first time we collaborated with that many pairs. It greatly improved our <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> skills which we used to simultaneously write code and for versioning. Necessiting many <strong>pull requests</strong> and <strong>branches</strong>, we decided to protect our master branch by forcing pairs to add other collaborators as reviewers before being able to <strong>merge</strong> their code on the master branch. <br>
    As exchanging roles after the first week was a precondition of the project, following this workflow allowed us to better reappropriate our collaborator's already written code in order to implement new features once we changed teams. <br>
    To facilitate our teamwork, we decided to have daily meetings to evaluate our progress and for decision-making. These meetings enabled us to effectively divide our tasks, which were tracked with the use of two <strong>Trello</strong> boards, one for the front-end, and another one for the back. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Features:</ins></strong> By linking the front and the back-end of the application through an API created with the use of Express.js, our goal was to implement several webstore related features such as: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        The display of furnitures on sale in the React.js application, according to their storage in the MySQL database, as well as the display of such furnitures on their personal information page, through <strong>HTTP GET routes</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The storage of furnitures' images on our express server with their corresponding slugs stored in our database made accessible through a <strong>HTTP GET route</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The possibility for a user to create a personal account through a registration form that will check the user's email validity, hash the user's password with the help of <strong>SHA256</strong> cryptographic hash and post her/his credentials in the database through a <strong>HTTP POST route</strong>. <br>
        This user's registration hence produced the possibility for a to login and logout in a connected session. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Making an order from the web application if you are a connected user and store that order in the database through a <strong>HTTP POST route</strong> by linking it to its related user and furnitures, which was quite a challenge for us in a relational database environment. 
    </ul>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Design and style:</ins></strong> Finally, the design of the website created with React.js and Tailwind.css challenged us into creating a professional-like webstore to promote our second-hand furnitures' shop. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/Gabrielparizet/travel_book" alt="Travel Book project repository">Travel Book</a><span> / February 2023</span></h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>About:</ins></strong> Travel Book is a social network developed in a group of three from an already written code in PHP using MySQL and WAMP for database handling. Our goal as a team was to reformat the already written code in the firstplace and to improve it by adding other functionalities and features in a second time. <br>
    Travel Book is a social network centered of travel themes. The core idea of the project is to allow users to share their travel's experience through their posts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Teamwork and organization:</ins></strong> Starting in pair-programming, we quickly moved to a task division using <strong>Trello</strong> and <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> for versioning.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>My role:</ins></strong> In this project, I endorsed the role of a lead-developer for the first time, driving our workflow, ensuring everyone was motivated by the realization of our social network and making sure features were developed on time. It was a big challenge through which I improved many team-work communication and perseverance skills by helping my other classmates to achieve their goals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><ins>Features:</ins></strong> Fully written in PHP which we were using for the first time, we implemented many social network related features, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creating a user account, stocking the user's credentials in a database and handling user's session login and logout.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating posts from a user account stocked in a relational database through a Post route taking the user's id into account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Associating posts to a Hashtag thanks to which we were able to get posts related to that particular Hashtag. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding the possibility to post a picture in a user's post with that picture being stocked in our server and its slug in our database, relating it to the post Id.
      <li>
        Handling likes for posts from a user account and stocking them in the database using the users' and posts' Ids. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to follow other users from their profiles and displaying the number of following and followed users in the connected user's personal profile.
      </li>
      <li>
        Posting a profile picture with the same technique used for posts' pictures, stocking the picture's slug in our database relating it to the user's Id.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
