My name is Gabriel, I am 28 years old, from Paris and I am a student in software engineering since October 2022 at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank"><img width="222" alt="img_logo_ada_white" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114992640/226121105-6b60144a-2be4-4511-8cb0-dee6c2bd0ffe.png">
<br>

At Ada, I am<b> autonomously </b>learning all the programming fundamentals necessary to become a software engineer: programming languages and paradigms, networks and systems, processus, database creation and handling, Q&A and software architecture.

<h2>GOAL</h2>

Developping a strong interest for data processing, servers' administration and communication and the building of APIs and their routes, my main goal is to find a 12 months apprenticeship as a <strong>back-end software engineer</strong>, starting between June 12th and July 7th 2023. I am very curious about back-end engineering and can't wait to learn more about it in depth so I can achieve my Goal to become senior back-end engineer in the years to come. 

This apprenticeship would work on the basis of Monday to Thursday at work and Fridays at school.
