<p>My name is Gabriel, I am 28 years old, from Paris and I am a student in software engineering since October 2022 at:</p>
<a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank"><img width="222" alt="img_logo_ada_white" src="./logos/ada_tech_school.png" alt="Ada Tech School Logo">
<br>

<p>At Ada, I am<b> autonomously </b>learning all the programming fundamentals necessary to become a software engineer: programming languages and paradigms, networks and systems, processus, database creation and handling, Q&A and software architecture.</p>

<h2>GOAL</h2>

![target](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114992640/227160287-02df8019-917f-44b6-8301-130f8b17d5af.png)

<p>Developping a strong interest for data processing, servers' administration and communication and the building of APIs and their routes, my main goal is to find a 12 months apprenticeship as a <strong>back-end software engineer</strong>, starting between June the 12th and July the 7th 2023. I am very curious about back-end engineering and can't wait to learn more about it in depth so I can achieve my Goal to become senior back-end engineer in the years to come. </p>

<p>This apprenticeship would work on the basis of Monday to Thursday at work and Fridays at school.</p>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/Gabrielparizet/music-recognition-project" alt="Link to sound data repository">Sound Data</a>

<p>Sound data is personal project I started recently and on which I am currently working on my free time.
The idea is to create a web application through which a user would be able to upload an audio file in order to get musical informations about it such as: the tempo (bpm), the length in minutes of the file and a graphical representation of the sound.</p>
<p>Currently working on an Minimum Viable Product, my goal for the V2 of <strong>Sound Data</strong> is to add the possibility to create an account in order to save the infos of a user's previously analyzed files, so they won't have to upload their files again.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The back-end (ongoing) is done in Python with the use of Flask for the building of the API's routes.</li>
  <li>
    The audio-files are processed through a python package named <strong>Librosa</strong> which is specifically designed for music and audio analysis.       </li>
  <li>The front-end (ongoing) is created with the use of React.js and Tailwind.css. </li>
  <li>In the V2, I am planning to add a MySQL relational database to handle user's account data and the saving of files' slugs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>School Group Projects</h3>

<p> At Ada Tech School, we have two weeks imposed school group projects every month through which we have to learn new technologies and notions by building the projects's goal application.</p>
<p> By working in an imposed group, we also work on our soft-skills, learning to communicate and to work in a team on the development of a program while using <strong>agile software development methods</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Vortex Blackhole is a space shooter game I developed with two classmates last October on the <strong>Pico-8 Fantasy Console </strong>.
  </li>
  <li> Essentially produced in pair-programming, this two weeks project allowed us to understand the role of functions and variables while discovering <strong>Lua</strong>, a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://github.com/Gabrielparizet/diario_web_extension_project" alt="Diaro Chrome Web Extension">Diario</a>
<ul>
  <li>
    Diario is a Chrome Web Extension project developed in a group of three using Chrome Extension Manifest V3.
  </li>
  <li>
    Diario changes the content of your new Google Chrome tabs and provides such features as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The display of the current weather based on the user's geolocation and time using Chrome's geolocation API and the open-meteo API for fetching weather's data. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Writing a ToDo List using Chrome's local-storage API.
      </li>
      <li>
        A carousel developed with <strong>Bootstrap.css</strong> displaying today's news fetched from the newsapi's API.
      </li>
      <li>
        The display of you chrome bookmarks in a tree-like layout using chrome.bookmarks API.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Diario also takes into account the user's time when he connects to the extension and adapts its theme accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Diario's program is fully written in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>, it allowed us to learn how to use the Document Object Model (DOM) programming interface.
  <li>
    The CSS grid was designed with the help of <strong>Bootstrap.css</strong> and is hence fully responsive.
  </li>
</ul>
